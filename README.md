# Weather App

The app shows the current weather and a five days forecast for Stockholm, Sweden. It was created for educational purposes as part of the Technigo Bootcamp for frontend developers in fall 2020. It's the first time I used an API.

## The requirements - what you will find in the code

The purpose of the project was to build a simple weather app using the data of an open API, in this case https://home.openweathermap.org . I fetch and display data on the current temperature, a weather description and descriptive icon, sunrise and sunset times, wind speed, air pressure and humidity. 
For the forecast, there is just the weekday, a weather icon and a minimum and maximum temperature shown. 

I learned how to fetch and use data from the API and how to only select specific parts of data, e.g. the minimum of several temperatures provided for one day, using methods and functions in JavaScript. I also improved my skills on operating with dates in JvaScript.

Also, I did the design following the template of a designer and thus learned how to do gradients and a shaped background in CSS. 

If there had been more time, I would have changed the background color depending on the current temperature and included more cities to choose between.

## Browser compatibility

The site is responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop and was tested with the dev tools of Chrome, Firefox and Edge. Everything works as expected. 

## View it live

The project is deployed on Netlify and you can view it here: https://henrikes-weather.netlify.app/
